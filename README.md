# Crowdfunding-ETL
This assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Extract Data
  - Using Python, Pandas, and the extract and transform phases of ETL, you’ll extract the raw data and add it to a DataFrame for the transform phase.
  
- Deliverable 2: Transform and Clean Data
  - Using Python, Pandas, and data cleaning strategies, you’ll transform the data via formatting, splitting, converting data types, and restructuring to create a DataFrame that can be loaded into a postgreSQL database as a CSV file.
  
- Deliverable 3: Create an ERD and Table Schema, and Load Data
  - Using the ERD that you created in this module, you’ll create a backers table that has primary and foreign keys based on the summary information about the backers.csv dataset. You'll then export the updated database schema as a PostgreSQL file and use it to create the backers table in the crowdfunding_db database. Finally, you'll use pgAdmin to upload the backers.csv file into the backers table.
  
- Deliverable 4: SQL Analysis
  - Using SQL, we performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database:
    - email_contacts_remaining_goal_amount.csv
    - email_backers_remaining_goal_amount.csv
